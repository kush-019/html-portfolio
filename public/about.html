<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Kushagra Srivastava, a 19-year-old with big dreams and an even bigger drive to achieve them. I'm currently a student at SRM University, Delhi-NCR, where I'm exploring my academic interests, sharpening my skills, and constantly pushing myself to grow.</p>

<p>I proudly come from Lucknow, a city rich in culture and heritage, which has shaped me into someone who values tradition but also thrives on innovation and new ideas. Being raised in such a vibrant place has helped me stay grounded, curious, and open-minded.</p>

<p>I consider myself a hard worker who doesn’t back down from a challenge. Whether it's academics, personal goals, or just everyday tasks—I give everything my 100%. I'm enthusiastic about learning, creating, and improving. To me, everything is a competition, not in a cutthroat way, but in the sense that I constantly strive to be better than I was yesterday. I'm always in pursuit of growth, excellence, and the next big opportunity.</p>

<p>Outside of studies, I’m incredibly passionate about football—I love the energy, the strategy, and the team spirit it brings. I also enjoy getting lost in movies, whether it's for inspiration, storytelling, or just unwinding after a long day. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired in everything I do.

  This portfolio is a reflection of who I am, where I come from, and where I’m headed. Thanks for stopping by—I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
